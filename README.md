## ✨ Features

*   **Customizable Grid:** Set your desired grid height and width to create canvases of any size.
*   **Intuitive Color Picker:** Easily select the perfect color for your pixels.
*   **Click & Drag Drawing:** Fill individual pixels by clicking, or draw continuously by clicking and dragging your mouse.
*   **Clear Canvas:** Start fresh with a single click using the "Clear Grid" button.
*   **Save Artwork:** Download your finished pixel art as a PNG image.
